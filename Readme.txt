Fork of https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.privately-owned-vehicles/

we update the python files in the folder Models/visualizations 

a. we added a preview to the video_visualization.py files and renamed them to video_visualization_preview.py
b. we added a file which can used with a camera called camera_visualization_cam.py

when you install the system the org visualizations folder will be renamed to visualizations_old
we aölso added a base folder in the home directory called autoware_projects, where you will find
- images
- videos
- weights
- commands

Which you will need to run the system. The video was recorded by us.

The System was tested on a X86 machine/NVIDIA GPU 20260 with Ubuntu 22.04
You can test all on your own risk!! 

If you have questions open an issue
